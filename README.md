Memory to Sunscreen

It's always good to refresh the memory.

Or it may slow down.
Getting backed up with fragments.


Of things put in.
That don't find the wayout.
Like crumbles of bread.



Under the toaster.
Stacking higher and higher.
Until they burn.
With the frozen pastry.




You just shoved in.
Flakes of frozen dough.
Sluff off like sun burnt skin.
Soothed with icy creamcheese.
Sunscreen smeared to heavy.
